# DC Shunt Motor Efficiency Analysis

## 1) Project Overview
This project presents an analytical and simulation-based study of a **DC shunt motor**, focusing on **efficiency calculation, power flow, losses, and performance behavior** under different operating conditions.

The analysis is carried out using **theoretical equations** and an **Excel-based model**, allowing clear visualization of how changes in voltage, current, torque, and speed affect motor efficiency.

This project was completed as part of the **Electrical Machines** course.

## 2) Project Objectives
- Calculate the efficiency of a **DC shunt motor**
- Analyze input power, output power, and losses
- Study motor behavior under varying operating conditions
- Visualize results using plots generated in Excel

---

## 3) Motor Description
A **DC shunt motor** has its field winding connected in parallel with the armature winding.  
This configuration provides:
- Nearly constant field current
- Stable magnetic field
- Almost constant speed under varying load conditions

### Main Components:
- **Armature winding**: Carries armature current and produces torque
- **Field (shunt) winding**: Produces the magnetic field

## 4) Analytical Calculations
The following parameters were calculated step by step:

- Field current (If)
- Angular speed (ω)
- Output mechanical power (Pout)
- Armature current (Ia)
- Input electrical power (Pin)
- Motor efficiency (η)
- Power losses (armature and field losses)

### Key Result:
- **Motor efficiency ≈ 90.37%** at the given operating point

## 5) Excel-Based Analysis
An Excel sheet was used to study the motor behavior under different conditions by:
- Varying the armature voltage
- Changing torque and angular speed
- Observing the effect on current, power, losses, and efficiency

---

## 6) Observations & Results
- **Efficiency** increases with higher voltage and load, exceeding 90% at higher operating points
- **Output power** increases with armature voltage
- **Torque** increases as speed increases
- **Losses**, especially armature copper losses, increase with current and voltage
- The DC shunt motor maintains stable behavior as expected
